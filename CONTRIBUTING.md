The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to JoyEngine. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## CLA

JoyMoe needs to obtain contributor signatures from all of you, so that we can offer JoyEngine to our customers under different indemnification terms.

## Testing

Regardless of the changes you are making, please make sure that your pull request includes appropriate unit tests.

## Submitting Changes

Please send a `Pull Request` with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes.
